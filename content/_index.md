        Welcome to the Zhao Research Group at Shanghai Jiao Tong University. Founded in late 2018 when Dr. Qibin Zhao joined the faculty, our lab was established in autumn 2020 with support from multiple funding sources. We develop scalable methods for fabricating diverse nano- and microstructured materials and explore novel physical mechanisms in miscellaneous soft-matter systems.
