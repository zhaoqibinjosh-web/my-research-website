   abstract = {<p>Stretching elastic materials containing nanoparticle lattices is common in research and industrial settings, yet our knowledge of the deformation process remains limited. Understanding how such lattices reconfigure is critically important, as changes in microstructure lead to significant alterations in their performance. This understanding has been extremely difficult to achieve due to a lack of fundamental rules governing the rearrangements. Our study elucidates the physical processes and underlying mechanisms of three-dimensional lattice transformations in a polymeric photonic crystal from 0% to over 200% strain during uniaxial stretching. Corroborated by comprehensive experimental characterizations, we present analytical models that precisely predict both the three-dimensional lattice structures and the macroscale deformations throughout the stretching process. These models reveal how the nanoparticle lattice and matrix polymer jointly determine the resultant structures, which breaks the original structural symmetry and profoundly changes the dispersion of photonic bandgaps. Stretching induces shifting of the main pseudogap structure out from the 1st Brillouin zone and the merging of different symmetry points. Evolutions of multiple photonic bandgaps reveal potential optical singularities shifting with strain. This work sets a new benchmark for the reconfiguration of soft material structures and may lay the groundwork for the study of stretchable three-dimensional topological photonic crystals.</p>},
