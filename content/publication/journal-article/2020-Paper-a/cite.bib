   abstract = {<p>A three-dimensional goniometric study of thin-film polymer photonic crystals investigates how the chromaticity of structural color is correlated to structural ordering. Characterization of chromaticity and the angular properties of structural color are presented in terms of CIE 1931 color spaces. We examine the viewing angle dependency of the Bragg scattering cone relative to sample symmetry planes, and our results demonstrate how increased ordering influences angular scattering width and anisotropy. Understanding how the properties of structural color can be quantified and manipulated has significant implications for the manufacture of functional photonic crystals in sensors, smart fabrics, coatings, and other optical device applications.</p>},
